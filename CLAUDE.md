# OpenAlice

File-driven AI trading agent. All state (sessions, config, logs) stored as files — no database.

## Quick Start

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev        # Dev mode (tsx watch, port 3002)
pnpm build      # Production build (backend + UI)
pnpm test       # Vitest
pnpm test:e2e   # e2e test
```

### Pre-commit Verification

Always run these checks before committing:

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit   # Type check (catches errors pnpm build misses)
pnpm test           # Unit tests
```

`pnpm build` uses tsup which is lenient — `tsc --noEmit` catches strict type errors that tsup ignores.

### Cross-platform note

Workspace bootstrap scripts (`src/workspaces/templates/*/bootstrap.sh`) are bash-based. On Windows they require `bash` from Git for Windows (default install) or WSL2. `workspace-creator.ts` already platform-branches the spawn so the same script paths work on win32 — when adding a new template, write bash as usual, but **don't** add POSIX-only commands without checking they ship with Git for Windows's bundled MSYS env (sed/cp/mkdir/basename/printf/source/[[ ]] all work; obscure tools like `jq` do not). See README's *Windows* section for the user-facing story.

## Subsystem guides

Some parts of this codebase are structured in ways that aren't obvious from
the code alone — easy to touch superficially, easy to miss load-bearing
wiring. When working on one of these, read its guide first:

- **Event / Listener / Producer system** — [docs/event-system.md](docs/event-system.md).
  Read before adding a new event type, Listener, or Producer, or before
  opening an event to HTTP via the webhook ingest. Has recipes + the full
  list of files to touch for each kind of change, plus a "common pitfalls"
  section for the kinds of things AI sessions have historically half-done.

## Working with TODO.md

`TODO.md` at the repo root is the running backlog — deferred work, known
bugs, security gaps, and design items sitting in the on-deck circle.
Unfinished items there compound over time if they're forgotten.

- **Before starting non-trivial work**, scan `TODO.md` for related entries.
  If there's one, either (a) handle it as part of the current change, or
  (b) confirm with the user why you're skipping it so it doesn't drift.
- **When finishing a change**, if it resolves a TODO entry, delete that
  entry in the same commit (git log is the history — the file is a
  future-looking list, not an audit trail).
- **When a new item surfaces mid-work** — a known-broken behaviour you
  don't have scope to fix, a security concern, a half-done UI surface —
  add it with enough context (symptom + suspected location) that the
  next person can start without re-derivation.

## Migrations

`data/config/` and other persisted user state evolve across releases.
Any upgrade-time transformation of user data — schema changes, file
renames, orphan cleanup, value backfills — MUST go through the
migration framework at `src/migrations/`, not ad-hoc startup code.

- New migrations live at `src/migrations/NNNN_short_name/index.ts` with
  a sibling spec. Append to `src/migrations/registry.ts`, then
  `pnpm build:migration-index` regenerates `src/migrations/INDEX.md`.
- Idempotency is enforced at two layers: the journal in
  `data/config/_meta.json` and the in-body self-check. Each migration
  body must no-op when data is already at the target shape.
- For files outside `data/config/` (e.g. `data/cron/jobs.json`,
  `data/sessions/`), the migration body uses raw `fs/promises` — the
  `ctx` helpers are config-scoped. Declare the affected paths in
  `affects` for `INDEX.md` surfacing.
- Past failure to avoid: inline one-time cleanup loops in `src/main.ts`
  or subsystem bootstrap. They are easy to call against unloaded state
  and silently no-op forever — a real incident left the cron engine
  firing orphan `__snapshot__` / `__heartbeat__` jobs every 15 min for
  weeks before anyone noticed.

## Key Architecture

### AgentCenter → GenerateRouter → GenerateProvider

Two layers (Engine was removed):

1. **AgentCenter** (`core/agent-center.ts`) — top-level orchestration. Manages sessions, compaction, and routes calls through GenerateRouter. Exposes `ask()` (stateless) and `askWithSession()` (with history).

2. **GenerateRouter** (`core/ai-provider-manager.ts`) — reads `ai-provider.json` on each call, resolves to active provider. Two backends:
   - Agent SDK (`inputKind: 'text'`) — Claude via @anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk, tools via in-process MCP
   - Vercel AI SDK (`inputKind: 'messages'`) — direct API calls, tools via Vercel tool system

**AIProvider interface**: `ask(prompt)` for one-shot, `generate(input, opts)` for streaming `ProviderEvent` (tool_use / tool_result / text / done). Optional `compact()` for provider-native compaction.

**StreamableResult**: dual interface — `PromiseLike` (await for result) + `AsyncIterable` (for-await for streaming). Multiple consumers each get independent cursors.

Per-request provider and model overrides via `AskOptions.provider` and `AskOptions.vercelAiSdk` / `AskOptions.agentSdk`.

### ConnectorCenter

`connector-center.ts` manages push channels (Web, Telegram, MCP Ask). Tracks last-interacted channel for delivery routing.

### ToolCenter

Centralized registry. `tool/` files register tools via `ToolCenter.register()`, exports in Vercel and MCP formats. Decoupled from AgentCenter.

## Conventions

- ESM only (`.js` extensions in imports), path alias `@/*` → `./src/*`
- Strict TypeScript, ES2023 target
- Zod for config, TypeBox for tool parameter schemas
- `decimal.js` for financial math
- Pino logger → `logs/engine.log`

## Git Workflow

- `origin` = `TraderAlice/OpenAlice` (production)
- `dev` branch for all development, `master` only via PR
- **Never** force push master, **never** push `archive/dev` (contains old API keys)
- CLAUDE.md is **committed to the repo and publicly visible** — never put API keys, personal paths, or sensitive information in it

### Branch Safety Rules

- **NEVER delete `dev` or `master` branches** — both are protected on GitHub (`allow_deletions: false`, `allow_force_pushes: false`)
- When merging PRs, **NEVER use `--delete-branch`** — it deletes the source branch and destroys commit history
- When merging PRs, **prefer `--merge` over `--squash`** — squash destroys individual commit history. If the PR has clean, meaningful commits, merge them as-is
- If squash is needed (messy history), do it — but never combine with `--delete-branch`
- `archive/dev-pre-beta6` is a historical snapshot — do not modify or delete
- **After merging a PR**, always `git pull origin master` to sync local master. Stale local master causes confusion about what's merged and what's not.
- **Before creating a PR**, always `git fetch origin master` to check what's already merged. Use `git log --oneline origin/master..HEAD` to verify only the intended commits are ahead. Stale local refs cause PRs with wrong diff.

### Rolling dev → master PR convention

Multiple Claude sessions hit `dev` in parallel; GitHub allows only **one
open PR per (head, base) pair** anyway. So we keep a single rolling PR
from `dev → master` and **append** to its body each session instead of
opening fresh — otherwise each new PR loses the context of what other
sessions did.

**Before opening a new PR, always check first:**

```bash
gh pr list --base master --head dev --state open --json number,title,body
```

- **If a PR exists** → append your section to its body with
  `gh pr edit <num> --body-file <(...)`. Don't open a new one.
- **If none exists** → open with `gh pr create` using the template below.

**PR body template:**

```markdown
## Summary
<rolling thematic summary — latest session may rewrite this when new
work meaningfully shifts the PR's framing>

## Per-session contributions
### YYYY-MM-DD — <session theme, e.g. "Market workbench tradeable card">
- What changed (1–3 bullets)
- Why
- Key commits: `<sha-short>`, `<sha-short>`

### YYYY-MM-DD — <prior session theme>
…(append on top, keep prior sessions verbatim — never edit other sessions' entries)…

## Full commit log
<output of: git log --oneline origin/master..HEAD>
(regenerate from scratch on each body update)

## Test plan
- [ ] tsc --noEmit clean
- [ ] pnpm test passes
- [ ] (session-specific manual verifications)

🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
```

**When you append:**

1. Refresh the "Full commit log" section from `git log --oneline origin/master..HEAD`.
2. Add your "Per-session contributions" entry on top of the list, with today's date.
3. Don't edit other sessions' entries — that's their record.
4. Update "Summary" only if your work actually changes the PR's framing
   (e.g., what was a "frontend tweak" PR becomes a "frontend + new domain
   service" PR after your work).

This keeps the PR description as a faithful audit trail across sessions,
and lets reviewers see who-did-what without trawling the commit log alone.

### Default vs. isolated branch — when to deviate from `dev`

The default for any session is **work on `dev`** and let the rolling
PR carry it to master. The exception is **invasive, long-running work
that shouldn't share a branch with parallel sessions** — typically a
refactor of shared types / cross-cutting infrastructure that, while
in-flight, would force every other session to rebase against churn
they don't have context for.

Examples worth isolating: changing a base interface every broker
implements; renaming or restructuring a module everyone imports from;
multi-day schema migrations.
Examples that stay on `dev`: any feature, any local fix, anything
scoped to one subsystem.

When isolation is the right call:

```bash
# Branch from master (clean baseline, dev's churn won't bleed in)
git fetch origin
git checkout master
git pull origin master
git checkout -b refactor/<short-name>

# During the refactor, periodically rebase against master so the
# eventual merge stays small. Skip dev — its session-by-session
# churn is intentionally not part of the baseline you're testing
# against.
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/master

# When done, PR straight to master (NOT dev). The refactor is its own
# coherent unit, reviewed end-to-end.
git push -u origin refactor/<short-name>
gh pr create --base master --head refactor/<short-name> ...
```

**After the refactor merges**, dev needs to absorb the new master so
in-flight sessions land on the new baseline:

```bash
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
git fetch origin
git merge origin/master
git push origin dev
```

In-flight rolling-PR work then sees the refactor in their next pull
and rebases naturally. Their diffs against the refreshed `dev` may
need real fix-ups (that's the cost of an invasive refactor — and
the reason you isolated it in the first place).

**Decision rule for the next session that starts work:** if `master`
is currently ahead of `dev`, do `git checkout dev && git merge origin/master`
*before* starting any new feature work. Otherwise your new commits
will land on a stale baseline.

Common reasons `master` would be ahead of `dev`:
- An invasive refactor branch just landed (above flow).
- A Claude Code cloud session opened a `claude/<short-desc>-XXXXX`
  branch and merged it straight to master without going through `dev`
  — typically for a time-sensitive fix the cloud agent shipped while
  the human wasn't around (see next subsection).

When the side-channel was content-bearing (not just a refactor) **dev
is genuinely behind master in code**, not just in merge-commit objects.
Skipping the sync lands new dev commits on stale code.

One quirk to recognize: a single `git merge origin/master` into dev
often surfaces a Discord/webhook notification like *"N new commits on
dev"* where N is much larger than what the side branch actually added.
Most of those N are **historical PR-merge commits** that have been
accumulating on master for weeks (each dev → master PR creates a
merge commit that exists only on master). The sync drags them onto
dev in one go. The webhook reports commit-object count, not
content-delta. Expected, not a sign anything's broken.

### Emergency hotfix via cloud `claude/*` side branch

A Claude Code cloud session can open a branch named
`claude/<short-desc>-XXXXX`, PR straight to master, and merge it
without touching `dev`. This is the right move for **genuine
emergencies** the user isn't around to handle on dev (a runtime
error blocking users, a CORS misconfiguration, a hotfix that can't
wait for the next dev → master cycle). The cloud session uses it
because:

- Cloud sessions don't see in-flight local dev state and shouldn't
  destabilize it
- The fix is small and reviewable in isolation
- Waiting for the user to bounce dev for a hotfix is silly when the
  cloud agent already has a working tree

**What this means for the next local session:**

1. `git fetch origin && git log --oneline origin/dev..origin/master`
   shows commits master has that dev doesn't — if there's anything
   from a `claude/*` branch, dev needs the sync.
2. `git checkout dev && git merge origin/master && git push origin dev`
   (clean FF in typical case).
3. Resume normal work on dev.

**What this means for the cloud session deciding whether to side-branch:**
default to opening a dev → master PR like everyone else. Only branch
straight to master for fixes that meet *both*: (a) production-impacting
or user-blocking, and (b) sub-100-line scope reviewable end-to-end in
one sitting. Anything bigger or speculative goes through dev.

**Parallel work happens in the cloud, not in local worktrees.** For a
project this size, spinning up multiple local worktrees costs more
in `pnpm install` / `data/` copying / port juggling than it saves.
Hand parallel tracks off to cloud Claude sessions instead — each
gets its own sandbox, returns a PR, and doesn't touch the local
working tree.
