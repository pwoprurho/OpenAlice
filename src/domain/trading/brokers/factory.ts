/**
 * Broker Factory — preset → engine resolver.
 *
 * Looks up the UTAConfig's preset, validates the user-facing form
 * data against the preset's own Zod schema, calls preset.toEngineConfig
 * to translate it into the engine-shaped dict, then delegates to the
 * target engine's fromConfig.
 *
 * UTAConfig.presetId is the only thing tying account records to
 * engine implementations — the engine identity is never serialized
 * directly. Swapping CCXT for a native client later means changing the
 * preset's `engine` field; on-disk account records stay valid.
