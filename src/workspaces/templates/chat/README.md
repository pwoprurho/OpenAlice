# Chat

A general-purpose Alice workspace. The agent boots with OpenAlice's full MCP tool surface — trading actions, market data, news, technical analysis — and Alice's persona pre-loaded as CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md.

## What this workspace does

This is the closest equivalent to "talk to Alice about anything trading-related." There's no pre-baked task, no specific data layout. The agent can quote tickers, place trades against your UTA accounts, pull news, and run indicators.

## When to spawn this

- You want a long-running thread with Alice that isn't tied to a specific research artifact or autoresearch loop.
- You're exploring an idea and don't yet know which workspace the job needs — Chat is the no-commitment starting point.
- You want quick access to the full MCP tool surface without setting up Auto-Quant clones or finance-skill trees.

## What you'll see in Inbox

(v1: Inbox is one-way — the agent posts; you don't reply through it.)

Things Alice will route here:
- Trade execution confirmations (when she places orders on your behalf).
- Market alerts she's been watching for you.
- Anything she flags as worth re-reading later.

## Parameters

When spawning, you'll configure:
- **Tag** — short identifier for this workspace (lowercase, dashes ok).

That's it. All available CLI runtimes (Claude, Codex, shell) are enabled by default; the template's first listed adapter is what the `+` "new session" button defaults to.
